            The SCIP database aims to increase knowledge of hazardous chemicals
            in articles and products on the EU market. Companies supplying
            articles containing Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) on the
            ECHA Candidate List in a concentration above 0.1% weight by weight
            (w/w) must submit notifications to ECHA.

            The Norruva platform, through its Digital Product Passports, can

            notifications.
