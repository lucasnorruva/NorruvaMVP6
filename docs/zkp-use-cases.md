# Conceptual Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Use Cases for Norruva DPP

## Introduction

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In the context of Digital Product Passports (DPPs), ZKPs offer a powerful mechanism to enhance privacy, protect sensitive business information, and enable selective disclosure while still providing verifiable claims.

This document outlines conceptual use cases for ZKPs within the Norruva DPP platform. These are high-level ideas and do not delve into specific ZKP schemes (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs) or their complex implementation details.

## Use Case 1: Material Compliance Verification (e.g., SVHC Content)

**Objective:** Prove that a product complies with material restrictions (e.g., contains less than 0.1% of a specific Substance of Very High Concern - SVHC) without revealing the full, proprietary Bill of Materials (BoM).

- **Private Data (Prover - Manufacturer/Supplier):**
  - Detailed Bill of Materials (BoM) with precise chemical composition and concentrations of all substances in each component.
  - CAS numbers and identifiers for all substances.
- **Public Claim:**
  - "Product X (or Component Y in Product X) contains less than 0.1% w/w of SVHC Z (e.g., Lead, CAS: 7439-92-1)."
  - "Product X complies with RoHS Article 4(1) regarding restricted substances."
- **ZKP Attestation:**
  - A ZKP that mathematically proves the public claim is true based on the private BoM, without exposing the full list of materials, their exact percentages (unless they are the SVHC in question and below the threshold), or other proprietary formulation details.
- **Conceptual Data Flow:**
  1.  **Proof Generation:** The manufacturer (prover) uses their private BoM as input to a ZKP generation service. This service (conceptually part of Norruva or a trusted third party) generates a proof for the specific claim (e.g., "Lead < 0.1%").
  2.  **Proof Storage/Linkage:** The generated ZKP is linked to the product's DPP, perhaps via a reference in the `compliance` section or a dedicated `verifiableClaims` array.
  3.  **Verification Request:** A verifier (e.g., regulator, consumer, B2B customer) wishes to confirm the claim. They might query the DPP for available ZKPs related to specific regulations or substances.
  4.  **Proof Verification:** The verifier obtains the ZKP and the public statement it proves. They use a ZKP verification algorithm (which only needs public inputs and the proof itself) to confirm the claim's validity.

## Use Case 2: Ethical Sourcing & Supply Chain Transparency

**Objective:** Attest that a specific raw material (e.g., cobalt in a battery) was sourced from a conflict-free region or meets certain ethical labor standards, without publicly disclosing the entire detailed supply chain or sensitive audit reports.

- **Private Data (Prover - Manufacturer/Supplier/Auditor):**
  - Full audit reports from suppliers or mines.
  - Detailed, potentially anonymized or pseudonymized, chain of custody records for specific batches of materials.
  - Internal supplier risk assessments and mitigation measures.
- **Public Claim:**
  - "The cobalt used in battery batch BXYZ for Product P was sourced in accordance with OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, as verified by Audit Firm A."
  - "Supplier S for component C adheres to fair labor standard FLS-2023."
- **ZKP Attestation:**
  - A ZKP proving that the claimed material batch passed specific audit criteria or originated from a set of certified (conflict-free) sources, without revealing the exact names of all intermediary suppliers, specific mine locations (if commercially sensitive), or the full content of audit reports.
- **Conceptual Data Flow:**
  1.  **Evidence Gathering:** The manufacturer collects private evidence (audit reports, CoC data).
  2.  **Proof Generation:** A ZKP is generated attesting that the evidence supports the public claim (e.g., an auditor might generate this ZKP).
  3.  **Proof Linkage:** The ZKP is linked to the DPP, potentially associated with a specific component or material declaration.
  4.  **Verification:** Stakeholders can verify the ethical sourcing claim by checking the ZKP without needing access to all underlying sensitive supplier data.

## Use Case 3: Product Authenticity & Anti-Counterfeiting (Advanced)

**Objective:** Allow a verifier (e.g., a consumer with a mobile app) to confirm a specific product instance is authentic and was genuinely manufactured by the claimed brand, without revealing the manufacturer's private cryptographic keys or a global database of all serial numbers.

- **Private Data (Prover - Manufacturer / Product's Secure Element):**
  - Manufacturer's private signing key.
  - A secret or unique cryptographic commitment embedded in the product (e.g., in a secure element, NFC tag) during manufacturing, linked to its unique serial number.
- **Public Claim:**
  - "This physical product instance (SN:XYZ123) is an authentic product manufactured by Brand B."
- **ZKP Attestation:**
  - The product (or a trusted app interacting with its secure element) can generate a ZKP proving it "knows" a secret that only an authentic product would possess, or that its identifier was validly signed by the manufacturer's key, without revealing the secret or the manufacturer's private key.
- **Conceptual Data Flow:**
  1.  **Manufacturing & Provisioning:** Authentic products are embedded with unique cryptographic material.
  2.  **Verification Interaction:** A consumer scans the product (e.g., NFC). The consumer's app (verifier) issues a challenge.
  3.  **Proof Generation:** The product's secure element or a manufacturer-authorized app (prover) uses its private information and the challenge to generate a ZKP.
  4.  **Proof Verification:** The consumer's app verifies the ZKP. A successful verification confirms authenticity.

## Use Case 4: Selective Disclosure of DPP Data

**Objective:** Allow a data owner (e.g., manufacturer) to prove specific attributes about a product to a requesting party (e.g., a business partner, regulator) without revealing the entire DPP or unrelated sensitive information.

- **Private Data (Prover - Manufacturer):**
  - The full Digital Product Passport data.
- **Public Claim (Dynamically Formulated by Requester & Agreed by Prover):**
  - "Does this product's carbon footprint (manufacturing phase) fall below X kg CO2e?"
  - "Is the recycled content of material Y in this product greater than Z%?"
  - "Was this product manufactured after date D?"
- **ZKP Attestation:**
  - A ZKP proving the specific queried attribute meets the condition, without revealing the exact value of the attribute (if not desired) or any other data from the DPP.
- **Conceptual Data Flow:**
  1.  **Data Query with Privacy:** A verifier requests proof for a specific statement about the product.
  2.  **Proof Generation:** The data owner (or their system holding the DPP) generates a ZKP based on the private DPP data to answer the verifier's query.
  3.  **Proof Sharing & Verification:** The ZKP is sent to the verifier, who can confirm the statement's truth.

## Benefits of Using ZKPs in DPPs

- **Enhanced Privacy:** Protects sensitive commercial data, intellectual property, and detailed supply chain relationships.
- **Selective Disclosure:** Allows data owners to share only necessary information, adhering to data minimization principles.
- **Increased Trust:** Provides strong, verifiable assurances without requiring full data exposure, fostering trust between parties who may not fully trust each other.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Can help meet privacy requirements (e.g., GDPR) while still fulfilling transparency and verification mandates of product regulations.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Complexity:** ZKP systems are complex to design, implement, and audit.
- **Performance & Cost:** Generating and verifying ZKPs can be computationally intensive, potentially impacting performance and cost.
- **Standardization:** Lack of widespread ZKP standards for DPP data attributes can hinder interoperability.
- **Scheme Selection:** Choosing the right ZKP scheme (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs) depends on the specific use case, security requirements, and performance trade-offs.
- **Trusted Setup:** Some ZKP schemes require a trusted setup ceremony, which can be a complex operational hurdle.

While challenging, the potential benefits of ZKPs for creating truly private yet verifiable Digital Product Passports are significant and represent a frontier for future development in the Norruva platform and the broader DPP ecosystem.
