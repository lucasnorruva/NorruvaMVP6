          <CardTitle>Introduction</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>
            The Norruva Digital Product Passport (DPP) platform is designed with
            data privacy, security, and compliance with regulations like GDPR as
            fundamental considerations. This guide outlines our conceptual
            approach to handling personal data, ensuring data subject rights,
            and maintaining a robust security posture.

          <p>
            While DPPs primarily focus on product-specific data, they can
            intersect with personal data related to manufacturers, suppliers,
            consumers, or platform users. Ensuring the robust protection of any
            such personal data, alongside the integrity and verifiability of
            product data, is paramount.
