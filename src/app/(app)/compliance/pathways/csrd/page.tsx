          Passports (DPPs) and the Norruva platform can support CSRD alignment.
          It is not exhaustive and is not legal or financial advice. Always
          consult CSRD experts and official ESRS documentation.

          <CardTitle>Introduction to CSRD & DPPs</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>
            The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)
            significantly expands sustainability reporting requirements for many
            EU companies. Digital Product Passports play a crucial role by
            providing granular, verifiable data at the product level, which is
            essential for comprehensive and accurate CSRD disclosures.

            The Norruva platform aims to help you structure and manage this
            product-specific data, making it easier to integrate into your
            broader CSRD reporting processes.

              The specific data points required for CSRD will depend on your
              company's materiality assessment and the applicable ESRS.

            <li>
              DPP data is a valuable input, but CSRD reporting encompasses
              broader organizational and value chain information beyond
              individual products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure robust data governance and verification processes for all
              information used in CSRD reports, including data from DPPs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay updated with evolving ESRS guidance and interpretations from
