            EBSI is a peer-to-peer network of distributed nodes across Europe,
            supporting cross-border public services using blockchain technology.
            Key aspects include its multi-ledger approach, decentralized
            identity (ESSIF), and focus on GDPR compliance.

            Smart contracts can play a crucial role in automating, governing,
            and enhancing the trustworthiness of DPPs within an EBSI-integrated
            system.

              Smart contracts can manage the state transitions of a DPP (e.g.,
              'draft', 'published', 'recalled', 'recycled'). They can enforce
              rules for who can trigger these transitions and log events
