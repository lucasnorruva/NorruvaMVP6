          <CardTitle>The Role of the Public Layer</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>
            The public layer in the Norruva architecture is designed to provide
            verifiable, transparent, and interoperable information about
            products, primarily leveraging concepts aligned with the European
            Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI).

        <CardContent className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            It aims to facilitate trust by allowing stakeholders (consumers,
            regulators, businesses) to verify key product claims and data points
            using standardized mechanisms. This layer complements potentially
            more private or detailed data managed elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>Key goals of the public layer include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>
              <strong>Interoperability:</strong> Ensuring DPP data can be
              understood and used across different systems and borders, aligning
              with EBSI's vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verifiability:</strong> Enabling independent verification
              of product claims through mechanisms like Verifiable Credentials
              (VCs).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> Providing accessible public
              information about product authenticity, key compliance aspects,
              and (optionally) ownership.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security:</strong> Utilizing cryptographic methods to
              ensure data integrity and authenticity of claims.

            <li>
              A manufacturer (or authorized issuer) generates a VC attesting to

              number), and manufacturing details.

            <li>
              This VC would be signed using a DID verifiable within the EBSI

            <li>
              The ID of this VC is stored in the product's DPP (

              Stakeholders can then retrieve this VC (conceptually, via a VC

              its signature and claims against the EBSI trust model.

            Alignment with EBSI Principles

        <CardContent className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Our conceptual approach to VCs and NFT-links aligns with EBSI's core
            principles:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li>
              <strong>Decentralized Identity (ESSIF):</strong> Issuers of VCs
              (e.g., manufacturers, certifiers) and owners (via DIDs linked to
              NFT ownership) would leverage ESSIF for managing their digital
              identities securely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verifiable Credentials:</strong> Authenticity claims,
              compliance attestations, and even ownership (if an NFT represents
              a VC) would be in the form of W3C-compliant VCs, verifiable
              against the EBSI trust framework.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interoperability:</strong> By using standardized VC data
              models and DID methods compatible with EBSI, DPP data becomes more
              interoperable across different EU systems and member states.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Integrity & Traceability:</strong> Anchoring VCs or
              proofs on an EBSI-conformant ledger (or a private ledger with
              proofs on EBSI) enhances data integrity and provides an immutable
              audit trail for key product events or claims.
            </li>

            This public layer architecture is conceptual. A full implementation
            would require careful consideration of specific EBSI use cases
            (e.g., a Diploma use case for product certifications, ESSIF for
            identity), selection of appropriate VC schemas, and robust
            integration with EBSI's APIs and trust infrastructure. The mock APIs
