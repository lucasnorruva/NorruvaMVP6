# Digital Twin Concepts for Norruva DPP

## Introduction

A **Digital Twin** is a virtual representation of a physical product, process, or system. In the context of a Digital Product Passport (DPP), a Digital Twin can provide dynamic, real-time information about the product's status, performance, and environment throughout its lifecycle.

This document outlines conceptual ideas for integrating Digital Twin data with the Norruva DPP platform.

## Key Concepts

1.  **DPP as a Pointer:** The DPP can act as a central hub that links to or aggregates data from a Digital Twin. It might not store all real-time twin data but would provide the means to access it.
    - **Digital Twin URI:** A field in the DPP (`productDetails.digitalTwin.uri`) could point to the specific Digital Twin instance on its native platform.

2.  **Data Integration:**
    - **Sensor Data Endpoint:** The DPP could list an API endpoint (`productDetails.digitalTwin.sensorDataEndpoint`) from which authorized parties can fetch live or recent sensor data (e.g., temperature, usage hours, stress levels).
    - **Real-Time Status:** A descriptive field in the DPP (`productDetails.digitalTwin.realTimeStatus`) could provide a summarized current status derived from the twin (e.g., "Operational - Optimal", "Needs Attention", "Offline").

3.  **Lifecycle Management:**
    - Digital Twins can provide rich data for lifecycle events. For example, a usage threshold reached in the twin could trigger a "Maintenance Required" event in the DPP.
    - Data from the twin (e.g., total operating hours, stress cycles) can be used to more accurately predict the End-of-Life (EOL) or optimal refurbishment time for a product.

4.  **Predictive Maintenance:**
    - The twin can analyze sensor data to predict potential failures or maintenance needs.
    - The DPP could then display these alerts (`productDetails.digitalTwin.predictiveMaintenanceAlerts`) to relevant stakeholders (e.g., owners, service providers).

5.  **Simulation & Optimization:**
    - Digital Twins can be used to simulate different usage scenarios or the impact of design changes. Insights from these simulations could (conceptually) feedback into future DPP versions or design improvements.

## Benefits for DPPs

- **Enhanced Transparency:** Provides a dynamic view of the product beyond static data.
- **Improved Maintenance:** Enables predictive and condition-based maintenance.
- **Extended Product Life:** Optimizes usage and repair to prolong the product's lifespan.
- **Better Circularity:** Offers more accurate data for refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling decisions.
- **Increased Value:** Provides ongoing value to users and stakeholders throughout the product's life.

## Norruva Platform - Conceptual Implementation

Currently, the Norruva platform's support for Digital Twins is **conceptual**. This involves:

- Dedicated fields in the product data model to store links and descriptive information related to a Digital Twin.
- UI elements in the product form and detail pages to manage and display this conceptual information.
- **No actual integration with live Digital Twin platforms or real-time data feeds is implemented in the current prototype.**

Future development could explore direct API integrations with common Digital Twin platforms or standards for data exchange.
